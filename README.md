This is a WebGL demo. It allows you to warp images, e.g. faces by dragging on them with the mouse. It's still a work-in-progress.

[lightgl.js][1] is used for convenience. When I started working on this, it very soon became apparent that WebGL is very low-level. So just to get something like a [Hello World][2] running, you need quite a lot of code. I still did write the logic, interaction and shaders myself.
